# nim

Nim is a game played by two people, who take turns selecting tokens from a board. The player who picks up the last token wins.

This implementation was written as an exercise while learning Clojure.

## Usage

In a repl:
(use '[nim.ctl] :reload)
(start-game) ;Initializes board to default preferences.
(take-tokens number-of-tokens) ;Player takes a turn by taking number-of-tokens
(machine-takes-turn) ;The application makes a choice for the current turn.

Note: machine-takes-turn does an exhaustive look-ahead, evaluating all possible moves. So it selects the next move that maximizes the ratio of winning end conditions over all possible end conditions.
